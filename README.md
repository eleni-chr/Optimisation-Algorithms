# Optimisation-Algorithms

Functions written by Dr Eleni Christoforidou in MATLAB.

Implementation of optimisation techniques, offering both simple and more complex variants of common methods.

**HillClimb_simple**
This function performs a hill climbing algorithm, which is an iterative optimisation algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found. The function uses a relatively simple function to which the problem is finding the global maximum.

**HillClimb_complex**
This function performs a hill climbing algorithm, which is an iterative optimisation algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found. The function uses a complex function to which the problem is finding the global maximum.

**GradientAscent_simple**
This function performs gradient ascent,  a first-order iterative optimisation algorithm for finding the maximum of a function. This algorithm uses a relatively simple function.

**GradientAscent_complex**
This function performs gradient ascent,  a first-order iterative optimisation algorithm for finding the maximum of a function. This algorithm uses a complex function.
